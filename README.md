qOracleCommittee.hpp â€” Decentralized Price Oracle
A committee of N addresses must sign for a price update. After bootstrapping, the contract is immutable: only valid committee-signed price updates are accepted, no admin keys, no upgrade, no backdoors. The committee logic is isolated for maximal security.
