# qOracle


qOracleCommittee.hpp — Decentralized Price Oracle
A committee of N addresses must sign for a price update. After bootstrapping, the contract is immutable: only valid committee-signed price updates are accepted, no admin keys, no upgrade, no backdoors. The committee logic is isolated for maximal security.


How to Use LaunchProtect in Your Contracts
```txt
 Inherit LaunchProtect in your main contract class (or use it as a member/composable if you prefer).

In every public/external method, add requireActive(sender); at the top, to restrict usage before launch is finalized.

The admin can call finalizeLaunch(admin); to open the contract to the world.

The admin can then (optionally, but strongly recommended!) call burnKey(admin); to make the contract fully immutable and non-upgradeable forever.

Any call to protected actions after burning the key will fail with a clear message.
```
Events Emitted
LaunchProtectInitialized: Shows deployer/admin at deployment.

LaunchFinalized: Records when the launch is opened.

KeyBurned: Irrevocable proof of key/ownership burn.

Production Checklist
 Zero-bloat: No unused code, pure security logic.

 Publicly queryable: Track init/burn status and admin.

 Human-readable events: For QubicScan/indexers.

 One-way switches: No way to revert initialization or un-burn the key.

 Code is law: All future actions are permissionless.

 This project, BANKON PYTHAI Token, demonstrates the minting of a synthetic token with extremely high decimal precision and robust launch protection on a next-generation chain (e.g., Qubic or similar quantum-ready chain). The token is engineered with a fixed, transparent, and immutable supply, combined with strict launch-time security protections—following the “code is law” philosophy.

Technical Overview
Token Standard: The contract is written in C++-style pseudo-code for a Qubic-compatible environment, using uint64_t for all balances and supply.

```txt
Total Supply: 100,000 tokens

Decimals: 12 (making 100,000.000000000000 BANKOJN PYTHAI units in total)

Minting: All tokens are minted at deployment, directly to the deployer’s address. There is no inflation or future minting possible—making the supply hard-capped and fully auditable from genesis.

Precision: With 12 decimals, the token supports sub-cent (or sub-satoshi) granularity, allowing for high-frequency DeFi and future quantum-financial applications.

Transfer Logic: Transfers are allowed between addresses with balance and overflow protection using native unsigned math.

Launch Protection: The token can include a LaunchProtect class (provided earlier or separately) to protect from sniping, front-running, or other exploits in the critical first moments after deployment.

Code is Law: Once deployed, the contract logic is immutable; no owner or admin can alter core logic, supply, or balances.

License: The contract is released under the Qubic Anti-Military License, restricting use in military contexts and ensuring open use for peaceful purposes.

BANKON PYTHAI is a highly precise, fixed-supply, suitable for synthetic token contract integration or inclusion that:

Uses integer math for all operations (no floats)

Has a total supply of exactly 100,000 tokens with twelve decimals: 100,000.000000000000

Is protected against common launch and trading exploits at genesis

Implements immutability, making it unstoppable, trust-minimized, and future-proof

Is designed to be used as the root unit-of-account in future DeFi or synthetic asset protocols, such as price-pegged assets or quantum-secure oracles.

# BANKON PYTHAI 
is the foundation for a production-ready BANKON PYTHAI token—intended for use on Qubic for next-generation quantum-ready blockchain transactions,

serving as the basis for pegged synthetic assets including qBTC, qETH, or qUSD stablecoin using price feeds/oracles.

BANKON PYTHAI Is immune to admin intervention, upgradable logic, or malicious upgrades by design.

Enforces the Qubic strict military-use ban via its license.

Guarantees user trust, since the supply, mint, and transfer logic are on-chain, auditable, and cannot be changed after deployment.

Is built with DeFi composability in mind: high decimals, atomic math, and anti-sniping tools allow it to participate in advanced protocols without upgrade or patch requirements.

#################################################################################

On deployment, all 100,000 tokens (with 12 decimals) are assigned to the deployer.

Tokens can be transferred between addresses as normal.

There are no mint or burn functions after genesis—the supply is forever fixed.

BANKON PYTHAI will integrate with qOracle as a DeFi protocols to create a highly reliable unit-of-value. BANKON PYTHAI has a fixed supply of 10000.000000000000 BANKON PYTHAI
